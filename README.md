Someone in a meeting keeps distracting you? Let's hide them.

This extension adds a toggle to hide attendees' video from you. Videos are only hidden in your local browser. They are still visible for other attendees.

The toggle can be found in an action menu of a participant in Show Everyone drawer. To expand the action menu, click on a participant's name. The hide video toggle is next to the remove participant button.

If an attendee does not have his/her video on, the video toggle will not be available.
